# BuddyPress Reels Enhanced - Issues Fixed

This document lists all the issues that were identified and resolved during the comprehensive project review.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Issues

- **Location**: `js/scripts.js`
- **Fix**: Removed or replaced with commented alternatives
- **Impact**: Cleaner console output in production

#### User Experience Issues
- **Issue**: Basic `alert()` dialogs were used for error/success messages
- **Location**: `js/scripts.js` - comment functionality
- **Fix**: Added fallback system that checks for custom notification function before using alerts
- **Impact**: Better user experience with more elegant notifications when available

#### Error Handling
- **Issue**: Generic error catching without user-friendly messages
- **Location**: Video autoplay and comment functionality
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Impact**: Better user experience during errors

### 2. PHP Security & Code Quality

#### Input Sanitization
- **Status**: ✅ **No Issues Found**
- **Verification**: All user inputs are properly sanitized using WordPress functions:
  - `sanitize_text_field()`
  - `sanitize_textarea_field()`
  - `sanitize_key()`
  - `esc_url()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_html()`

#### CSRF Protection
- **Status**: ✅ **No Issues Found**

- **Issue**: Individual reel pages conflicted with Instagram-style vertical feed experience
- **Location**: `templates/single-reel.php` and related template hooks

- **Additional Changes**:
  - Added `template_redirect` hook to redirect single reel URLs to main feed
